This SDK is for client-side JS applications that run in a web browser. For server-side JS applications, use Eppo's [server-side Node JS SDK](https://github.com/Eppo-exp/node-server-sdk).

## Getting Started

Refer to our [SDK documentation](https://docs.geteppo.com/feature-flags/sdks/client-sdks/javascript) for how to install and use the SDK.
