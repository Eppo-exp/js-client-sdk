## Classes

|  Class | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [ChromeStorageEngine](./js-client-sdk.chromestorageengine.md) | <p>Chrome storage implementation of a string-valued store for storing a configuration and its metadata.</p><p>This serializes the entire configuration object into a string and then stores it to a single key within the object for another single top-level key. Same with metadata about the store (e.g., when it was last updated).</p><p>Note: this behaves a bit differently than local storage as the chrome storage API gets and sets subsets of key-value pairs, so we have to dereference or re-specify the key.</p> |
|  [EppoJSClient](./js-client-sdk.eppojsclient.md) | Client for assigning experiment variations. |
|  [EppoPrecomputedJSClient](./js-client-sdk.eppoprecomputedjsclient.md) |  |
